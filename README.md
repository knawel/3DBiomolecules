# 3DBiomolecules
Essential tutorial for 3D computer grafics for biomolecules and organic molecules

The tutorial covers the following topics:
- Neccecary basics of Blender
- Creation of 3D models (PyMol)
- Import of \*.WRL files.
- Materilas 
- Modifiers
- Light
- Nodes 
- Basic of animation

# Intro

There are common specialized tools for making the excellent quality images. In most cases any of these programm is enouph for exploration of the 3D protein model and generation high-quality results. These programs also are highly custumizable, it possible to write scripts for even deeper fine tuning.
However, in my opinion, sometimes the combination with general purpuse 3D modeling software (like Blender) allows to reach the desirable results faster. Also, the 3D design community has huge knoladge data and it's much easier to find the proper tutorial/advise.

In most cases the common molecular manipulation/modeling/visualization software give the wnecesssary results easier and faster. Here a list of my favorate apps:

- [PyMol](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source)
- [UCSF Chimera ](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/)
- [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
- [OneAngstrom](https://www.oneangstrom.com/)

However, I found a few cases, when it's easier to use **PyMol** (or any other molecular visualization software) + **Blender**. For example:

- You need to combine protein with any non-molecular object (text, arrows, boxes, etc)
- You have to cut protein in very specific way to demontsrate something inside (binding pocket, ligands)
- You want more flexibility in materials, light.
- You make animation, simulate some real-world physical phenomena (gravity, water movement)
