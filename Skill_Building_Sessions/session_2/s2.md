# Enhancing Visualization with Materials, Lighting, and Shaders

## Overview
Focus on how to make protein and small molecules more visually appealing and scientifically informative by using material and lighting system.

## Objectives
- Setting Up Basic Lighting, Filming
- Applying Materials to Different Parts of the Model
- Introduction to Shaders
- Environment Maps for Reflection and Lighting

## Materials
- PDBID `8U16`


## Examples

Load protein, select CRBN protein as a surface, ligand as ball and stick, SALL4 protein and Zn ion (as spheres).

A good practice is clean up vertices (merge by distance) for each objects.

Save it as `s2_general.blend` for using in the further examples.




### Light and Camera 
There is an excellent tutorial about lights in blender from BlenderGuru here.
Typically I prefere the classical three-point lighting scheme:

**Key Light (Main Light)**
- The key light is the primary and brightest source of light.
- It's usually positioned at a 45-degree angle from the subject, either to the left or right.
- The purpose is to define the form, casting shadows and creating depth.

**Fill Light**
- The fill light is positioned on the opposite side of the key light, also around a 45-degree angle from the subject but at a lower intensity.
- It softens the shadows created by the key light, balancing the lighting on the subject's face or object and reducing harsh contrasts.

**Back Light (Rim Light or Hair Light)**
- Positioned behind the subject, slightly above and angled downward, the back light
- Its purpose is to separate the subject from the background, giving a three-dimensional look.
