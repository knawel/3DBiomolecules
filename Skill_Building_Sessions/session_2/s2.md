# Enhancing Visualization with Materials, Lighting, and Shaders

## Overview
Focus on how to make protein and small molecules more visually appealing and scientifically informative by using material and lighting system.

## Objectives
- Setting Up Basic Lighting, Filming
- Applying Materials to Different Parts of the Model
- Introduction to Shaders
- Environment Maps for Reflection and Lighting

## Materials
- PDBID `8U16`


## Examples

Load protein, select CRBN protein as a surface, ligand as ball and stick, SALL4 protein and Zn ion (as spheres).

A good practice is clean up vertices (merge by distance) for each objects.

Save it as `s2_general.blend` for using in the further examples.
