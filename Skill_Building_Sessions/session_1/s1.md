# Import Structures from PDB

## Overview
The aim of this session is to demonstrate the options for loading objects into Blender and making basic initial preparations.

## Objectives
- Load a protein as a surface and a ligand as ball-and-stick using PyMol.
- Perform initial preparation of the objects.

## Input Files
List of any materials or resources needed for this session.

## Steps

### 1. Install Blender Extensions
The VRML2 format provides the highest compatibility between PyMol and Blender. However, since Blender v4.2 no longer supports this format by default, youâ€™ll need an extension. Download it from [this webpage](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/web3d-x3d-vrml2-format/).

### 2. Open PDB File in PyMol
Open the `8uh6.cif` file and create the desired representations. In this case, the protein is depicted as a surface, and the ligand as a ball-and-stick model. See [hints](./s1_hints.md).

```
set stick_radius, 0.16
set stick_ball, on
set stick_ball_ratio, 1.1
```

The color of the surface doesn't matter, as it won't be transferred into Blender. It is better to export the objects one by one.

### 3. Export Objects from PyMol
- Make only the ligand visible. Export it by navigating to "File -> Export Image As -> VRML 2" and save it as `pymol/ligand.wrl`.
- Make only the protein visible. Export it and save it as `pymol/protein.wrl`.

### 4. Import the Ligand into Blender
- In Blender, go to "File -> Import -> X3D Extensible 3D" and select the `pymol/ligand.wrl` file.
- The ligand will be imported as multiple objects. It is convenient to join them together. Select all balls and sticks (excluding Viewpoint and DirectLight) and join them (`Ctrl + J` or "Object -> Join").

### 5. Import the Protein Surface
- Import the protein surface in the same way: "File -> Import -> X3D Extensible 3D" and select the `pymol/protein.wrl` file.

### 6. Clean Up the Surface
(**Important step!**) Clean up the surface to remove extra vertices:
- Select the surface.
- Enter *Edit Mode* (press `Tab`).

- Clean up the surface: "Mesh -> Clean Up -> Merge by Distance."
- You should notice some vertices being removed:

- Return to *Object Mode*.

### 7. Organize Objects and Collections
- Rename the objects and organize them into collections (e.g., "molecules" and "stage").
- Remove any DirectLights and Viewpoints.

### 8. (Optional) Scale Objects
The original size of the imported objects might be too large (e.g., 61.5 x 51.8 x 47.6 meters, the size of a small building). You may want to scale them down to a manageable size:
- Press `N` to open the side panel.
- Select both the protein and ligand.
- Scale down by pressing `S`, typing `0.01`, and hitting `Enter`.
- Center the objects using `Shift + S -> 7 -> .`.
- Apply the scale: `Ctrl + A -> Scale`.

### 9. Add Camera and Lighting
- Add a Camera and Point Light to the "Stage" collection and adjust their positions.

### 10. Final Adjustments for Rendering
- Position the camera (using the "Camera to View" option can help).
- Adjust the lighting and add material to the protein surface.
- For a transparent background, enable "Transparent" in the Render Properties under "Film -> Transparent."

## Conclusion
This is a basic workflow that allows the import of molecular structures into Blender.
The final result might looks like this ![alt](img/S1.png)

## Challenges (Optional)
Challenge 1: Repeat the process using VMD, but add color to the surface.
- Use b-factor for coloring
- Save as Wavefront (OBJ/MTL)
