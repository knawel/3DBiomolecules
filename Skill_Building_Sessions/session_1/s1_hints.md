### Settings for Small Molecules

I personally recommend using the settings from this [cheat sheet](https://peakproteins.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Steves-PyMol-Cheat-Sheet-Protocol.pdf). Please note that using the default stick model can result in poorly connected bonds when exporting the scene, even if it looks fine in PyMol.
